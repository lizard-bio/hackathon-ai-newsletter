## :hammer_and_pick: Getting Started

Follow these steps:

1. Install and activate the conda environment.
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate {{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}
    ```

2.  (optional) make src/ available as a Python package so that you can include it in your notebooks
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

3. install the pre-commit hooks
    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. Start coding!
