- abstract: Bacterial remineralization of algal organic matter fuels algal growth
    but is rarely quantified. Consequently, we cannot currently predict whether some
    bacterial taxa may provide more remineralized nutrients to algae than others.
    Here, we quantified bacterial incorporation of algal-derived complex dissolved
    organic carbon and nitrogen and algal incorporation of remineralized carbon and
    nitrogen in fifteen bacterial co-cultures growing with the diatom Phaeodactylum
    tricornutum at the single-cell level using isotope tracing and nanoSIMS. We found
    unexpected strain-to-strain and cell-to-cell variability in net carbon and nitrogen
    incorporation, including non-ubiquitous complex organic nitrogen utilization and
    remineralization. We used these data to identify three distinct functional guilds
    of metabolic interactions, which we termed macromolecule remineralizers, macromolecule
    users, and small-molecule users, the latter exhibiting efficient growth under
    low carbon availability. The functional guilds were not linked to phylogeny and
    could not be elucidated strictly from metabolic capacity as predicted by comparative
    genomics, highlighting the need for direct activity-based measurements in ecological
    studies of microbial metabolic interactions.

    Observational studies have linked lipid-lowering drug targets Pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) and HMG-CoA Reductase (HMGCR) with adverse liver outcomes; however, liver disease incidence varies across diverse populations and the long-term hepatic impact of these lipid-lowering drugs among non-white Europeans remains largely unknown.
    We use single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PCSK9 and HMGCR loci from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in four populations (East Asian [EAS], South Asian [SAS], African [AFR], and European [EUR]) to perform drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) investigating relationships between PCSK9 and HMGCR inhibition and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bilirubin.
    Analyses of PCSK9 instruments, including functional variants R46L and E670G, failed to find evidence for relationships of LDL-C lowering via PCSK9 variants and adverse effects on ALT, AST, GGT, or ALP among the cohorts. PCSK9 inhibition was associated with increased direct bilirubin levels in EUR (β=0.089, p-value=5.69×10

- abstract: Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a male-biased heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
    disorder that affects approximately 1%-2% of the population. Prenatal exposure
    to valproic acid (VPA) is a recognized risk factor for ASD, but the cellular and
    molecular basis of VPA-induced ASD at the single-cell resolution is unclear. Here,
    we aimed to compare the cellular and molecular differences in the hippocampus
    between male and female prenatal mice with ASD at the single-cell transcriptomic
    level. The transcriptomes of more than 45,000 cells were assigned to 12 major
    cell types, including neurons, glial cells, vascular cells, and immune cells.
    Cell type-specific genes with altered expression after prenatal VPA exposure were
    analyzed, and the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
    found in neurons, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and microglia. In microglia,
    several pathways related to inflammation were found in both males and females,
    including the TNF, NF-κB, Toll-like receptor, and MAPK signaling pathways, which
    are important for the induction of autistic-like behavior. Additionally, we noted
    that several X-linked genes, including Bex1, Bex3, and Gria3, were among the male-specific
    DEGs of neurons. This pioneering study describes the landscape of the transcriptome
    in the hippocampus of autistic individuals. The elucidation of sexual differences
    could provide innovative strategies for the prevention and treatment of ASD.

    Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal malignant tumor in hematology. Mitophagy plays vital roles in the pathogenesis and drug sensitivity of MM.
    We acquired transcriptomic expression data and clinical index of MM patients from NCI public database, and 36 genes involved in mitophagy from the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was conducted to construct a risk score prognostic model. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operation characteristic curves (ROC) were conducted to identify the efficiency of prognosis and diagnosis. ESTIMATE algorithm and immune-related single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to uncover the level of immune infiltration. QRT-PCR was performed to verify gene expression in clinical samples of MM patients. The sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs was evaluated upon the database of the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC).
    Fifty mitophagy-related genes were differently expressed in two independent cohorts. Ten out of these genes were identified to be related to MM overall survival (OS) rate. A prognostic risk signature model was built upon on these genes: VDAC1, PINK1, VPS13C, ATG13, and HUWE1, which predicted the survival of MM accurately and stably both in training and validation cohorts. MM patients suffered more adverse prognosis showed more higher risk core. In addition, the risk score was considered as an independent prognostic element for OS of MM patients by multivariate cox regression analysis. Functional pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on risk score showed terms of cell cycle, immune response, mTOR pathway, and MYC targets were obviously enriched. Furthermore, MM patients with higher risk score were observed lower immune scores and lower immune infiltration levels. The results of qRT-PCR verified VDAC1, PINK1, and HUWE1 were dysregulated in new diagnosed MM patients. Finally, further analysis indicated MM patients showed more susceptive to bortezomib, lenalidomide and rapamycin in high-risk group.
    Our research provided a neoteric prognostic model of MM based on mitophagy genes. The immune infiltration level based on risk score paved a better understanding of the participation of mitophagy in MM.

- abstract: The six species of lungfish possess both lungs and gills and are the closest
    extant relatives of tetrapods. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptome atlas
    of the West African lungfish (Protopterus annectens). This species manifests the
    most extreme form of terrestrialization, a life history strategy to survive dry
    periods that can last for years, characterized by dormancy and reversible adaptive
    changes of the gills and lungs. Our atlas highlights the cell type diversity of
    the West African lungfish, including gene expression consistent with phenotype
    changes of terrestrialization. Comparison with terrestrial tetrapods and ray-finned
    fishes reveals broad homology between the swim bladder and lung cell types as
    well as shared and idiosyncratic changes of the external gills of the West African
    lungfish and the internal gills of Atlantic salmon. The single-cell atlas presented
    here provides a valuable resource for further exploration of the respiratory system
    evolution in vertebrates and the diversity of lungfish terrestrialization.

- abstract: The lack of genome editing platforms has hampered efforts to study and
    improve forage crops that can be grown on lands not suited to other crops. Here,
    we established efficient Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in
    a perennial, stress-tolerant forage grass, sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis). By screening
    for active single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), accessions that regenerate well, suitable
    Agrobacterium strains, and optimal culture media, and co-expressing the morphogenic
    factor TaWOX5, we achieved 11% transformation and 5.83% editing efficiency in
    sheepgrass. Knocking out Teosinte Branched1 (TB1) significantly increased tiller
    number and biomass. This study opens avenues for studying gene function and breeding
    in sheepgrass. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

    Comparative gene expression studies in apes are fundamentally limited by the challenges associated with sampling across different tissues. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of embryoid bodies to collect transcriptomic data from over 70 cell types in three humans and three chimpanzees.
    We find hundreds of genes whose regulation is conserved across cell types, as well as genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in one or a handful of cell types. Using embryoid bodies from a human-chimpanzee fused cell line, we also infer the proportion of inter-species regulatory differences due to changes in cis and trans elements between the species. Using the cis/trans inference and an analysis of transcription factor binding sites, we identify dozens of transcription factors whose inter-species differences in expression are affecting expression differences between humans and chimpanzees in hundreds of target genes.
    Here, we present the most comprehensive dataset of comparative gene expression from humans and chimpanzees to date, including a catalog of regulatory mechanisms associated with inter-species differences.

- abstract: Although multiple pancreatic islet single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
    datasets have been generated, a consensus on pancreatic cell states in development,
    homeostasis and diabetes as well as the value of preclinical animal models is
    missing. Here, we present an scRNA-seq cross-condition mouse islet atlas (MIA),
    a curated resource for interactive exploration and computational querying. We
    integrate over 300,000 cells from nine scRNA-seq datasets consisting of 56 samples,
    varying in age, sex and diabetes models, including an autoimmune type 1 diabetes
    model (NOD), a glucotoxicity/lipotoxicity type 2 diabetes model (db/db) and a
    chemical streptozotocin β-cell ablation model. The β-cell landscape of MIA reveals
    new cell states during disease progression and cross-publication differences between
    previously suggested marker genes. We show that β-cells in the streptozotocin
    model transcriptionally correlate with those in human type 2 diabetes and mouse
    db/db models, but are less similar to human type 1 diabetes and mouse NOD β-cells.
    We also report pathways that are shared between β-cells in immature, aged and
    diabetes models. MIA enables a comprehensive analysis of β-cell responses to different
    stressors, providing a roadmap for the understanding of β-cell plasticity, compensation
    and demise.

- abstract: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare but aggressive malignancy with cellular
    and immunological characteristics that remain unclear. Here, we perform transcriptomic
    analysis for 111,038 single cells from tumor tissues of six MBC and thirteen female
    breast cancer (FBC) patients. We find that that MBC has significantly lower infiltration
    of T cells relative to FBC. Metastasis-related programs are more active in cancer
    cells from MBC. The activated fatty acid metabolism involved with FASN is related
    to cancer cell metastasis and low immune infiltration of MBC. T cells in MBC show
    activation of p38 MAPK and lipid oxidation pathways, indicating a dysfunctional
    state. In contrast, T cells in FBC exhibit higher expression of cytotoxic markers
    and immune activation pathways mediated by immune-modulatory cytokines. Moreover,
    we identify the inhibitory interactions between cancer cells and T cells in MBC.
    Our study provides important information for understanding the tumor immunology
    and metabolism of MBC.

- abstract: Single-cell genomics technologies are ushering in a new research era.
    In this review, we summarize the benefits and current challenges of using these
    technologies to probe the transcriptional regulation of plant development. In
    addition to profiling cells at a single snapshot in time, researchers have recently
    produced time-resolved datasets to map cell responses to stimuli. Live-imaging
    and spatial transcriptomic techniques are rapidly being adopted to link a cell's
    transcriptional profile with its spatial location within a tissue. Combining these
    technologies is a powerful spatiotemporal approach to investigate cell plasticity
    and developmental responses that contribute to plant resilience. Although there
    are hurdles to overcome, we conclude by discussing how single-cell genomics is
    poised to address developmental questions in the coming years.

- abstract: "Defective lymphatic drainage and translocation of B-cells in inflamed
    (Bin) joint-draining lymph node sinuses are pathogenic phenomena in patients with
    severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
    this lymphatic dysfunction remain poorly understood. Herein, we utilized multi-omic
    spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate altered cellular composition
    (including lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells) in
    the joint-draining lymph node sinuses and their associated phenotypic changes
    and cell-cell interactions during RA development using the tumor necrosis factor
    transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model.\nPopliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) from wild-type
    (n=10) and TNF-Tg male mice with \"Early\" (5 to 6-months of age; n=6) and \"Advanced\"
    (>8-months of age; n=12) arthritis were harvested and processed for spatial transcriptomics.
    Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed in PLNs from the TNF-Tg cohorts
    (n=6 PLNs pooled/cohort). PLN histopathology and ELISPOT along with ankle histology
    and micro-CT were evaluated. Histopathology of human lymph nodes and synovia was
    performed for clinical correlation.\nAdvanced PLN sinuses exhibited an increased
    \nCollectively, these data support a model of flare in chronic TNF-induced arthritis
    in which loss of lymphatic flow through affected joint-draining lymph nodes facilitates
    the interaction between effluxing macrophages and T-cells via ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation,
    initiating IgG2b class-switching and plasma cell differentiation of the expanded
    Bin population. Future work is warranted to investigate immunoglobulin clonality
    and potential autoimmune consequences, as well as the efficacy of anti-CD6 therapy
    to prevent these pathogenic events."

- abstract: |-
    Disease relapse and therapy resistance remain serious impediments to treating cancer. Leukemia stem cells (LSC) are therapy resistant and the cause of relapse. A state of deep quiescence appears to enable cancer stem cells (CSC) to acquire new somatic mutations essential for disease progression and therapy resistance. Both normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and LSC share many common features, thereby complicating the safe elimination of LSC. A recent study demonstrated that long lived normal oocytes exist without mitochondrial complex I (MC-1), expressing it in a developmentally regulated fashion, thereby mitigating their vulnerability to ROS. Quiescent CSC rely on mitochondrial FAO, without complex I expression, thereby avoiding the generation of damaging ROS, similar to long lived normal human stem cells. A deeper understanding of the biology of therapy resistance is important for the development of optimal strategies to attain complete leukemia cures.
    Here, using scRNA-sequencing and ATAC-seq on primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient samples, combined with bioinformatics analyses, we further examine the heterogeneity of a previously characterized in vitro imatinib-selected CD34-CD38- CML LSC population. We utilized a series of functional analyses, including single-cell metabolomic and Seahorse analyses, to validate the existence of the deepest quiescent leukemia initiators (LI) subset.
    Current study revealed heterogeneity of therapy resistant LSC in CML patients and their existence of two functionally distinct states. The most deeply quiescent LI suppress the expression of MC-1, yet are highly dependent on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for their metabolic requirements and ATAC-seq demonstrated increased chromatin accessibility in this population, all consistent with an extremely primitive, quiescent stemness transcriptional signature. Importantly, the specific CREB binding protein (CBP)/β-catenin antagonist ICG-001 initiates the differentiation of LSC, including LI, decreases chromatin accessibility with differentiation and increasing expression of MC-1, CD34, CD38 and BCR-ABL1, thereby re-sensitizing them to imatinib.
    We investigated the biological aspects related to LSC heterogeneity in CML patients and demonstrated the ability of specific small molecule CBP/β-catenin antagonists to safely eliminate deeply quiescent therapy resistant CSC. These observations may represent an attractive generalizable therapeutic strategy that could help develop better protocols to eradicate the quiescent LSC population.

- abstract: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
    functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
    understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
    shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
    association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
    mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict
    that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
    Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
    and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for
    a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
    expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
    associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
    is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
    action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
    that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
    modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
    can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
    single-gene strategies.

- abstract: Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) is a complex rearrangement that leads to
    tumor malignancy. Existing models for detecting BFBs rely on the ideal BFB hypothesis,
    ruling out the possibility of BFBs entangled with other structural variations,
    that is, complex BFBs. We propose an algorithm Ambigram to identify complex BFB
    and reconstruct the rearranged structure of the local genome during the cancer
    subclone evolution process. Ambigram handles data from short, linked, long, and
    single-cell sequences, and optical mapping technologies. Ambigram successfully
    deciphers the gold- or silver-standard complex BFBs against the state-of-the-art
    in multiple cancers. Ambigram dissects the intratumor heterogeneity of complex
    BFB events with single-cell reads from melanoma and gastric cancer. Furthermore,
    applying Ambigram to liver and cervical cancer data suggests that the BFB mechanism
    may mediate oncovirus integrations. BFB also exists in noncancer genomics. Investigating
    the complete human genome reference with Ambigram suggests that the BFB mechanism
    may be involved in two genome reorganizations of Homo Sapiens during evolution.
    Moreover, Ambigram discovers the signals of recurrent foldback inversions and
    complex BFBs in whole genome data from the 1000 genome project, and congenital
    heart diseases, respectively.

- abstract: 'To gain deeper insights into transcriptomes and epigenomes of organoids,
    liver organoids from two states (expandable and more differentiated) were subjected
    to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) analyses.
    Mitochondrial gene expression was higher in differentiated than in non-differentiated

    Differentiation of liver organoids resulted in the expression of transcription
    factors that act as enhancers and repressors. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms

    in liver organoids and adult liver. Knockdown of PDX1, an essential transcription
    factor for pancreas development, led to the hepatic maturation of liver organoids
    through regulation of AFP and ALB expression. This integrative analysis of the

- abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) studies have provided critical
    insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
    2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). scRNA-Seq
    library preparation methods and data processing workflows are generally designed
    for the detection and quantification of eukaryotic host mRNAs and not viral RNAs.
    Here, we compare different scRNA-Seq library preparation methods for their ability
    to quantify and detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs with a focus on subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs).
    We show that compared to 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' (10X 3')
    libraries or 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J (10X 5') libraries
    sequenced with standard read configurations, 10X 5' libraries sequenced with an
    extended length read 1 (R1) that covers both cell barcode and transcript sequence
    (termed "10X 5' with extended R1") increase the number of unambiguous reads spanning
    leader-sgmRNA junction sites. We further present a data processing workflow, single-cell
    coronavirus sequencing (scCoVseq), which quantifies reads unambiguously assigned
    to viral sgmRNAs or viral genomic RNA (gRNA). We find that combining 10X 5' with
    extended R1 library preparation/sequencing and scCoVseq data processing maximizes
    the number of viral UMIs per cell quantified by scRNA-Seq. Corresponding sgmRNA
    expression levels are highly correlated with expression in matched bulk RNA-Seq
    data sets quantified with established tools for SARS-CoV-2 analysis. Using this
    scRNA-Seq approach, we find that SARS-CoV-2 gene expression is highly correlated
    across individual infected cells, which suggests that the proportion of viral
    sgmRNAs remains generally consistent throughout infection. Taken together, these
    results and corresponding data processing workflow enable robust quantification
    of coronavirus sgmRNA expression at single-cell resolution, thereby supporting
    high-resolution studies of viral RNA processes in individual cells. IMPORTANCE
    Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has emerged as a valuable tool to study
    host-virus interactions, especially for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here
    we compare the performance of different scRNA-Seq library preparation methods
    and sequencing strategies to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs and develop a data processing
    workflow to quantify unambiguous sequence reads derived from SARS-CoV-2 genomic
    RNA and subgenomic mRNAs. After establishing a workflow that maximizes the detection
    of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs, we explore patterns of SARS-CoV-2 gene expression
    across cells with variable levels of total viral RNA, assess host gene expression
    differences between infected and bystander cells, and identify non-canonical and
    lowly abundant SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. The sequencing and data processing strategies
    developed here can enhance studies of coronavirus RNA biology at single-cell resolution
    and thereby contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis.

    sequencing.

- abstract: |-
    We hypothesized that transcriptomic profiling of muscle satellite cells in peripheral artery disease (PAD) would identify damage-related pathways contributing to skeletal muscle myopathy. We identified a potential role for ferroptosis-a form of programmed lytic cell death by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation-as one such pathway. Ferroptosis promotes myopathy in ischemic cardiac muscle but has an unknown role in PAD.
    Muscle satellite cells from donors with PAD were obtained during surgery. cDNA libraries were processed for single-cell RNA sequencing using the 10X Genomics platform. Protein expression was confirmed based on pathways inferred by transcriptomic analysis.
    Unsupervised cluster analysis of over 25 000 cells aggregated from 8 donor samples yielded distinct cell populations grouped by a shared unique transcriptional fingerprint. Quiescent cells were diminished in ischemic muscle while myofibroblasts and apoptotic cells were prominent. Differential gene expression demonstrated a surprising increase in genes associated with iron transport and oxidative stress and a decrease in GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4) in ischemic PAD-derived cells. Release of the danger signal HMGB1 (high mobility group box-1) correlated with ferroptotic markers including surface transferrin receptor and were higher in ischemia. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation in muscle satellite cells was modulated by ferrostatin, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Histology confirmed iron deposition and lipofuscin, an inducer of ferroptosis in PAD-affected muscle.
    This is the first report documenting that genes known to be involved in ferroptosis are differentially expressed in human skeletal muscle affected by PAD. Targeting ferroptosis may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce PAD myopathy.

- abstract: Mammalian organs exhibit distinct physiology, disease susceptibility,
    and injury responses between the sexes. In the mouse kidney, sexually dimorphic
    gene activity maps predominantly to proximal tubule (PT) segments. Bulk RNA sequencing
    (RNA-seq) data demonstrated that sex differences were established from 4 and 8 weeks
    after birth under gonadal control. Hormone injection studies and genetic removal
    of androgen and estrogen receptors demonstrated androgen receptor (AR)-mediated
    regulation of gene activity in PT cells as the regulatory mechanism. Interestingly,
    caloric restriction feminizes the male kidney. Single-nuclear multiomic analysis
    identified putative cis-regulatory regions and cooperating factors mediating PT
    responses to AR activity in the mouse kidney. In the human kidney, a limited set
    of genes showed conserved sex-linked regulation, whereas analysis of the mouse
    liver underscored organ-specific differences in the regulation of sexually dimorphic
    gene expression. These findings raise interesting questions on the evolution,
    physiological significance, disease, and metabolic linkage of sexually dimorphic
    gene activity.
