"""Generate an image to accompany the literature summary
---

This script reads in the ChatGPT publication summary and generates an 
accompanying DALL-E image. The prompt for DALL-E is designed by 
ChatGPT based on the summary and some additional keywords.

Usage:
python dalle.py \
	-s | --summary: path to the text file with the publication 
					summary for which the images need to be 
					generated. This text needs to be included into the 
					prompt for DALL-E.
	-o | --output: file where the generated image is stored
