- summary: The abstract from paper [2] discusses the quantification of bacterial incorporation of algal-derived organic matter and the remineralization of carbon and nitrogen. The study found strain-to-strain and cell-to-cell variability in net carbon and nitrogen incorporation, as well as the identification of three distinct functional guilds of metabolic interactions. These guilds were not linked to phylogeny and could not be predicted solely based on metabolic capacity, emphasizing the importance of direct activity-based measurements in microbial ecological studies [2].\n\nIn paper [1], a high-throughput, multiplexed single-cell technology called TISCC-seq was developed to engineer and measure the phenotypic consequences of predesignated mutations in cells. The technology utilizes CRISPR base editors to introduce mutations, and long-read sequencing is used to identify the engineered mutations in the target gene's transcript. The transcriptome profile of the same cells is simultaneously analyzed using short-read sequencing. By integrating these data, the mutations' genotype and expression phenotype can be determined at single-cell resolution. Using this approach, the impact of over 100 TP53 mutations on gene expression was evaluated, and the mutations were classified based on their functionally significant phenotype [1].\n\nThe abstract from paper [3] presents a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the West African lungfish (Protopterus annectens), which possesses both lungs and gills. This species exhibits extreme terrestrialization, characterized by dormancy and reversible adaptive changes of the gills and lungs to survive dry periods. The atlas reveals the cell type diversity of the West African lungfish and gene expression consistent with phenotype changes associated with terrestrialization. Comparison with other vertebrates shows homology between swim bladder and lung cell types, as well as shared and unique changes in gills. This atlas provides valuable insights into the evolution of the respiratory system in vertebrates and the diversity of lungfish terrestrialization [3].\n\nThe abstract from paper [4] focuses on male breast cancer (MBC) and its cellular and immunological characteristics. Transcriptomic analysis of single cells from tumor tissues of MBC and female breast cancer (FBC) patients revealed that MBC has significantly lower infiltration of T cells compared to FBC. Metastasis-related programs were found to be more active in MBC cancer cells. Fatty acid metabolism, particularly involving FASN, was associated with cancer cell metastasis and low immune infiltration in MBC. T cells in MBC showed activation of p38 MAPK and lipid oxidation pathways, indicating a dysfunctional state. In contrast, T cells in FBC exhibited higher expression of cytotoxic markers and immune activation pathways mediated by immune-modulatory cytokines. The study also identified inhibitory interactions between cancer cells and T cells in MBC, providing important insights into the tumor immunology and metabolism of MBC [4].\n\nThe abstract from paper [5] introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies [5].
