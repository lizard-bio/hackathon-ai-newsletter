- summary: This scientific study explored how the internal circadian clock in animals, which regulates their daily rhythms, works in a fruit fly model. The researchers discovered previously unknown connections between clock neurons in the fly's brain, which help synchronize these neurons and make the clock more robust. They also found new pathways through which light can influence the clock's functioning, and identified signaling mechanisms involving neuropeptides that contribute to the network controlling daily rhythms and hormone signaling in fruit flies.
