- summary: This research focuses on pancreatic cancer and how certain factors in the tumor's surrounding environment, specifically Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), play a critical role in making the tumor resistant to treatment and promoting its growth. The study suggests that inhibiting HDACs with a drug called entinostat can reduce the activation of surrounding cells and slow down the progression of the tumor. This discovery highlights the potential of targeting these epigenetic factors as a promising approach in pancreatic cancer therapy.
