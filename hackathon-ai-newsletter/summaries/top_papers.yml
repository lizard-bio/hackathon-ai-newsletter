- summary: The computational approach PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action [1]. Single-cell genomics technologies have the potential to revolutionize research in plant development [2]. The single-cell transcriptome atlas of the West African lungfish reveals the evolutionary adaptations of this species to terrestrialization [3]. Sexually dimorphic gene activity maps predominantly to proximal tubule (PT) segments in the mouse kidney, and androgen receptor (AR)-mediated regulation of gene activity in PT cells is the regulatory mechanism [4]. The Igh locus has extensive conformational heterogeneity and interacts with B-lineage genes, facilitating the production of a diverse antibody repertoire [5]. Single-cell RNA sequencing of embryoid bodies was used to study the relationship between regulatory changes in cis and trans and the evolution of gene expression in humans and chimpanzees [6]. The algorithm Ambigram is proposed to identify complex breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) rearrangements and reconstruct the rearranged structure of the local genome during the cancer subclone evolution process [7]. The single-cell transcriptome analysis of male breast cancer (MBC) reveals fatty acid metabolism-mediated metastasis and immunosuppression. MBC has significantly lower infiltration of T cells compared to female breast cancer (FBC), and metastasis-related programs are more active in cancer cells from MBC. Fatty acid metabolism involving FASN is related to cancer cell metastasis and low immune infiltration in MBC. T cells in MBC show a dysfunctional state, while T cells in FBC exhibit higher expression of cytotoxic markers and immune activation pathways mediated by immune-modulatory cytokines. Inhibitory interactions between cancer cells and T cells are identified in MBC [8]. Single-cell isotope tracing reveals functional guilds of bacteria associated with the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Bacterial remineralization of algal organic matter fuels algal growth but is rarely quantified. We quantified bacterial incorporation of algal-derived complex dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen and algal incorporation of remineralized carbon and nitrogen in fifteen bacterial co-cultures growing with the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum at the single-cell level using isotope tracing and nanoSIMS. We found unexpected strain-to-strain and cell-to-cell variability in net carbon and nitrogen incorporation, including non-ubiquitous complex organic nitrogen utilization and remineralization. We used these data to identify three distinct functional guilds of metabolic interactions, which we termed macromolecule remineralizers, macromolecule users, and small-molecule users, the latter exhibiting efficient growth under low carbon availability. The functional guilds were not linked to phylogeny and could not be elucidated strictly from metabolic capacity as predicted by comparative genomics, highlighting the need for direct activity-based measurements in ecological studies of microbial metabolic interactions [9]. The scRNA-seq cross-condition mouse islet atlas (MIA) integrates over 300,000 cells from nine scRNA-seq datasets consisting of 56 samples, varying in age, sex, and diabetes models. The β-cell landscape of MIA reveals new cell states during disease progression and cross-publication differences between previously suggested marker genes. β-cells in the streptozotocin model transcriptionally correlate with those in human type 2 diabetes and mouse db/db models, but are less similar to human type 1 diabetes and mouse NOD β-cells. Pathways that are shared between β-cells in immature, aged, and diabetes models are also reported. MIA enables a comprehensive analysis of β-cell responses to different stressors, providing a roadmap for the understanding of β-cell plasticity, compensation, and demise [10]. Multi-omics analysis identifies IgG2b class-switching with ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation in joint-draining lymph nodes during advanced inflammatory-erosive arthritis. Defective lymphatic drainage and translocation of B-cells in inflamed (Bin) joint-draining lymph node sinuses are pathogenic phenomena in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this lymphatic dysfunction remain poorly understood. Herein, we utilized multi-omic spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate altered cellular composition (including lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells) in the joint-draining lymph node sinuses and their associated phenotypic changes and cell-cell interactions during RA development using the tumor necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model. Advanced PLN sinuses exhibited an increased Collectively, these data support a model of flare in chronic TNF-induced arthritis in which loss of lymphatic flow through affected joint-draining lymph nodes facilitates the interaction between effluxing macrophages and T-cells via ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation, initiating IgG2b class-switching and plasma cell differentiation of the expanded Bin population. Future work is warranted to investigate immunoglobulin clonality and potential autoimmune consequences, as well as the efficacy of anti-CD6 therapy to prevent these pathogenic events [11].
